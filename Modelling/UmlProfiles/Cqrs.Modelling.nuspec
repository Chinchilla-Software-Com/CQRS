			A visual designer for the lightweight CQRS.net framework. Using this package you can generate much of the boiler plate code involved in implementing a scalable, enterprise grade CQRS project ready for deployment on-premise or on Azure.

			Model commands, events and aggregates visually and let all the handlers and boiler plate code be generated for you utilising the CQRS.net platform.

		<releaseNotes>
			Version 1.601

			* Added code generation for the base Host class.
			* Added new stereo type on relationships to visually model aggregate to event EventHandlers
			* Added new stereo type on relationships to visually model event to command converter EventHandlers
			* Added new stereo type on relationships to visually model command to aggregate CommandHandlers
			* Updated the EventHandlerTemplate.t4 to properly target any event and an entity optionally. If no Entity is specified the generated class name is that of the model class.
			* Added AutoGenerateAllProperties property to the AggregateRoot and Entity stereo-types to automatically have the AggregateProperty/EntityProperty stereo-type added to all properties - soon the stereo-type property will be needed for T4 generation
			* Added AutoGenerated stereo-type for use in the diagrams and to populate the UML with feature based objects so they can be linked to and used. Anything with this added will not be generated when the feature is completed.
			* Create, Update and Delete auto generated commands now add themselves automatically by switching the stereotype value.
			* Updated the templates to support associations from commands to aggregates to events
			* Updated MongoDB to 3.0 and added legacy support. 3.0 now support eventstores and datastores
			* Added BlobStorage eventstores and datastores
			* Added public/private event attributes support.
			* Added public/private notification attributes support.
